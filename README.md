# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Jeomin Gimmi

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.


1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

   > 6 days

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

   > For assignment 2 I will start earlier and work iteratively. Next time I will ask peer feedback before 
   > finishing the work.
